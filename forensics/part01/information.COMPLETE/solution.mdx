##### DESCRIPTION
Files can always be changed in a secret way. Can you find the flag? [cat.jpg](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b4d62f6e431dc8e563309ea8c33a06b3/cat.jpg)

### WALKTHROUGH
I tried steghide, but I needed a password, so I found out about exiftool which gives all the metadata of files.

### FLAG
