## First Grep

###### AUTHOR: ALEX FULTON/DANNY TUNITIS
##### DESCRIPTION
Can you find the flag in [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/495d43ee4a2b9f345a4307d053b4d88d/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

##### WALKTHROUGH
With the given file, if we `cat` the contents, it is a jumbled mess of incomprehensible characters. The description is right about a better way to look through this, let's use `grep` like the title says. 

```bash
$ cat file | grep "pico"
```
And grep automatically finds the line with the text we are looking for!
