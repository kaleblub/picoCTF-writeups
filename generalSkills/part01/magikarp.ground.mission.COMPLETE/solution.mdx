## Magikarp Ground Mission

### AUTHOR: SYREAL
### DESCRIPTION
Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `6d448c9c`

### WALKTHROUGH
To get started, we have to Launch Instance. Once up, we use the provided ssh command below the Description.
For me this time: 
```bash
ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 53053
```
It asks if you're sure you want to continue, type 'yes' and hit 'Enter'.
It will then ask you for the password, use the password they gave, '6d448c9c'.

After that, let's run 'ls' like they tell us to.

```bash 
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt
```
With both of those text files, let's see what is inside of them.
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat *
picoCTF{xxsh_
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`
```
Looks like we have 1/3 of the flag, let's follow the instructions they give us.

```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ..
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  boot  etc   instructions-to-3of3.txt  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
bin	       dev   home  lib			     media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```
There is the second piece! Let's get it and add it to our first piece, while we're at it, let's read the instructions to the final piece of the flag.
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2of3.flag.txt instructions-to-3of3.txt
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
```
Almost there! Let's navigate to '~':
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in
```
There's the final piece! Let's get it!
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3of3.flag.txt
5190b070}
```
