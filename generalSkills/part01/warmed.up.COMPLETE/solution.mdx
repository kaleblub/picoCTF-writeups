## Warmed Up

### AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS
### DESCRIPTION
What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

### WALKTHROUGH
Using the technically unnecessary first step in *Lets Warm Up*, we can again simply enter the hexadecimal number into the Python Interpreter:
```python
0x3D
```
which outputs 61
