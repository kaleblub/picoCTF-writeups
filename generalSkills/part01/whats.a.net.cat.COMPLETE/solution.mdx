## what's a net cat?

### AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS
### DESCRIPTION
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to ***jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org*** at port ***64287*** to get the flag?

### WALKTHROUGH
We simply follow the instructions they give us, and they do give us the flag. Let's netcat that domain on that port.
```bash
nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 64287
-> You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
-> picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}
```

### FLAG
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}
