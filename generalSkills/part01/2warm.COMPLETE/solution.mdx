### DESCRIPTION
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

### WALKTHROUGH
In the Python Interpreter, we can use the bin() method, which converts and returns the binary equivalent string of a given integer.
```python
bin(42)
```
gives us: '0b101010'

For the flag, we should take off the '0b' part, which is just used by the computer to differentiate binary numbers from numbers in base 10 representation.

### FLAG
picoCTF{101010}
