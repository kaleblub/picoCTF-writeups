## Lets Warm Up

### DESCRIPTION
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

### WALKTHROUGH
Using the Python Interpreter, we can easily see the given hexadecimal number in Unicode by just inputting the number and pressing Enter: 
```python
0x70
``` 
which gives us the output of: 112

Next, we can use python's chr() method, which returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is an integer.
```python
chr(0x70)
```
returns: 'p'
