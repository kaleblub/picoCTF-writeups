## Nice netcat...

### AUTHOR: SYREAL
### DESCRIPTION
There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: ***$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239***, but it doesn't speak English...

### WALKTHROUGH

When we enter 
```bash
nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239
```
We get weird output as numbers printed out on many lines.
```bash
	112 
	105 
	99 
	111 
	67 
	84 
	70 
	123 
	103 
	48 
	48 
	100 
	95 
	107 
	49 
	116 
	116 
	121 
	33 
	95 
	110 
	49 
	99 
	51 
	95 
	107 
	49 
	116 
	116 
	121 
	33 
	95 
	55 
	99 
	48 
	56 
	50 
	49 
	102 
	53 
	125 
	10
```
We can save that into an output file with:
```bash
nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239 > netcat_output.txt
```
Now that we have saved those numbers for later, let's write a python script to translate the ASCII coded numbers into Unicode.
```python
ascii_to_unicode = []
with open('netcat_output.txt', 'r') as f:
	for line in f.readlines():
		ascii_to_unicode.append(chr(int(line)))
	print(''.join(ascii_to_unicode))
```
**On Line 1**, we get an empty list ready to add each translated ASCII coded number to.
**On Line 2**, with the output file(**netcat_output.txt**) open it for reading, refer to it as **'f'**
**Then On Line 3**, we check each line in all the lines of the output file and for each of those lines **Line 4**, we make sure python recognizes it as an integer instead of a string with 'int()', then we check that integer's Unicode equivalent with 'chr()', and finally, with that value, we append it to our list at the beginning.
**Finally, On Line 5**, we print the whole list after we turn it into a string, which is our flag.
