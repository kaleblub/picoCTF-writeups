## Wave a flag

### AUTHOR: SYREAL
### DESCRIPTION
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [**This program**](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/a14be2648c73e3cda5fc8490a2f476af/warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...

### WALKTHROUGH
To start, we have to make the 'warm' file executable.
```bash
chmod +x warm
```
Let's try to run it now?
```bash
./warm
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
```
All right then, let's pass the '-h' flag to it to get the help message.
```bash
./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_755f3544}
```
There it is!

### FLAG
picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_755f3544}
