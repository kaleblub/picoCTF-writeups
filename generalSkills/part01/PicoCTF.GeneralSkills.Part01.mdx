## 2Warm

###### AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS
##### DESCRIPTION
Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

##### WALKTHROUGH
In the Python Interpreter, we can use the bin() method, which converts and returns the binary equivalent string of a given integer.
```python
bin(42)
```
gives us: '0b101010'

For the flag, we should take off the '0b' part, which is just used by the computer to differentiate binary numbers from numbers in base 10 representation.

##### FLAG
picoCTF{101010}

## Lets Warm Up

###### AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS
##### DESCRIPTION
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

##### WALKTHROUGH
Using the Python Interpreter, we can easily see the given hexadecimal number in Unicode by just inputting the number and pressing Enter: 
```python
0x70
``` 
which gives us the output of: 112

Next, we can use python's chr() method, which returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is an integer.
```python
chr(0x70)
```
returns: 'p'

##### FLAG
picoCTF{p}

## Magikarp Ground Mission

###### AUTHOR: SYREAL
##### DESCRIPTION
Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `6d448c9c`

##### WALKTHROUGH
To get started, we have to Launch Instance. Once up, we use the provided ssh command below the Description.
For me this time: 
```bash
ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 53053
```
It asks if you're sure you want to continue, type 'yes' and hit 'Enter'.
It will then ask you for the password, use the password they gave, '6d448c9c'.

After that, let's run 'ls' like they tell us to.

```bash 
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt
```
With both of those text files, let's see what is inside of them.
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat *
picoCTF{xxsh_
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`
```
Looks like we have 1/3 of the flag, let's follow the instructions they give us.

```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ..
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  boot  etc   instructions-to-3of3.txt  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
bin	       dev   home  lib			     media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```
There is the second piece! Let's get it and add it to our first piece, while we're at it, let's read the instructions to the final piece of the flag.
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2of3.flag.txt instructions-to-3of3.txt
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
```
Almost there! Let's navigate to '~':
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in
```
There's the final piece! Let's get it!
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3of3.flag.txt
5190b070}
```

##### FLAG
picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_5190b070}

## Nice netcat...

###### AUTHOR: SYREAL
##### DESCRIPTION
There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: ***$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239***, but it doesn't speak English...

##### WALKTHROUGH

When we enter 
```bash
nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239
```
We get weird output as numbers printed out on many lines.
```bash
	112 
	105 
	99 
	111 
	67 
	84 
	70 
	123 
	103 
	48 
	48 
	100 
	95 
	107 
	49 
	116 
	116 
	121 
	33 
	95 
	110 
	49 
	99 
	51 
	95 
	107 
	49 
	116 
	116 
	121 
	33 
	95 
	55 
	99 
	48 
	56 
	50 
	49 
	102 
	53 
	125 
	10
```
We can save that into an output file with:
```bash
nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239 > netcat_output.txt
```
Now that we have saved those numbers for later, let's write a python script to translate the ASCII coded numbers into Unicode.
```python
ascii_to_unicode = []
with open('netcat_output.txt', 'r') as f:
	for line in f.readlines():
		ascii_to_unicode.append(chr(int(line)))
	print(''.join(ascii_to_unicode))
```
**On Line 1**, we get an empty list ready to add each translated ASCII coded number to.
**On Line 2**, with the output file(**netcat_output.txt**) open it for reading, refer to it as **'f'**
**Then On Line 3**, we check each line in all the lines of the output file and for each of those lines **Line 4**, we make sure python recognizes it as an integer instead of a string with 'int()', then we check that integer's Unicode equivalent with 'chr()', and finally, with that value, we append it to our list at the beginning.
**Finally, On Line 5**, we print the whole list after we turn it into a string, which is our flag.

## Obedient Cat

####### AUTHOR: SYREAL
##### DESCRIPTION
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").[***Download flag***](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/217686fc11d733b80be62dcfcfca6c75/flag).

##### WALKTHROUGH

Download the file and cat the file:
```bash
cat flag
picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_b5aeb3dd}
```

##### FLAG

picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_b5aeb3dd}

## Python Wrangling

###### AUTHOR: SYREAL
##### DESCRIPTION
Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run [this Python script](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/8e33ede04d02f3765b8c6a6e24d72733/ende.py) using [this password](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/8e33ede04d02f3765b8c6a6e24d72733/pw.txt) to get [the flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/8e33ede04d02f3765b8c6a6e24d72733/flag.txt.en)?

##### WALKTHROUGH
In this one, we start out provided with three files
```bash
ls
ende.py  flag.txt.en  pw.txt
```
pw.txt = Text file with the password in it.
	-> aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16
flag.txt.en = Text file that holds the encrypted flag. 
	-> gAAAAABgUAIWjVP_Ne1VPrHlLZKpvfaifN7qlLoN7NEzOpAl55av7sPuV8wQZj9V-6oI_x4L10O8R-b9c19INaTFrlGbT6YxQeLXd2S3FQA8HmFxU9NILpJGEtVPsGpzPAmLSsRwezRX
ende.py = Python script that we are told to use with the password to decrypt the flag.

We can copy the password for later, and try running 'ende.py':
```bash
python3 ende.py
Usage: ende.py (-e/-d) [file]
```
Looks like we just need to add either -e or -d, (we will add '-d' because we are decrypting), we also need to substitute or flag.txt.en in as [file].
```bash
python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en
Please enter the password:aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16aa821c16
picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_aa821c16}
```

##### FLAG
picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_aa821c16}

## Static ain't always noise

###### AUTHOR: SYREAL
##### DESCRIPTION
Can you look at the data in this binary: [static](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/bc72945175d643626d6ea9a689672dbd/static)? This [BASH script](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/bc72945175d643626d6ea9a689672dbd/ltdis.sh) might help!

##### WALKTHROUGH

For this one I just ran
```bash
strings static | grep "pico"
```

##### FLAG
picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_1e6a7731}

## strings it

###### AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS
##### DESCRIPTION
Can you find the flag in [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/5bd86036f013ac3b9c958499adf3e2e2/strings) without running it?

##### WALKTHROUGH
After downloading the file, using the hint of the challenge's title 'strings it', run the ```strings``` command with a grep to filter for the pico flag
```strings strings | grep "pico"```

##### FLAG
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_827aee91}

## Tab, Tab, Attack

###### AUTHOR: SYREAL
##### DESCRIPTION
Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: [Addadshashanammu.zip](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/659efd595171e4c40378be6a2e9b7298/Addadshashanammu.zip) 

##### WALKTHROUGH
With the given zip file, run: 
```bash
unzip Addadshashanammu.zip
Archive:  Addadshashanammu.zip
   creating: Addadshashanammu/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/
   creating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku/
  inflating: Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku/fang-of-haynekhtnamet  
``` 
That gives us the folder structure within the zip file.
On the completion of ```unzip```, it prints what folders and files were created and inflated. We get a lengthy descent of 7 folders deep and 1 file at the end. I just copy/pasted the path to the file and ran: 
```bash
strings Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku/fang-of-haynekhtnamet | grep "pico"
```

## Warmed Up

###### AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS
##### DESCRIPTION
What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

##### WALKTHROUGH
Using the technically unnecessary first step in *Lets Warm Up*, we can again simply enter the hexadecimal number into the Python Interpreter:
```python
0x3D
```
which outputs 61

##### FLAG
picoCTF{61}

## Wave a flag

###### AUTHOR: SYREAL
##### DESCRIPTION
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [**This program**](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/a14be2648c73e3cda5fc8490a2f476af/warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...

##### WALKTHROUGH
To start, we have to make the 'warm' file executable.
```bash
chmod +x warm
```
Let's try to run it now?
```bash
./warm
Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!
```
All right then, let's pass the '-h' flag to it to get the help message.
```bash
./warm -h
Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_755f3544}
```
There it is!

##### FLAG
picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_755f3544}

## what's a net cat?

###### AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS
##### DESCRIPTION
Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to ***jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org*** at port ***64287*** to get the flag?

##### WALKTHROUGH
We simply follow the instructions they give us, and they do give us the flag. Let's netcat that domain on that port.
```bash
nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 64287
-> You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
-> picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}
```

##### FLAG
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_284be8f7}
