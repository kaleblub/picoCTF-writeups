## 13

###### AUTHOR: ALEX FULTON/DANIEL TUNITIS
##### DESCRIPTION
Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? `cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}`

##### WALKTHROUGH
All right, so obviously we just need to run a ROT13 decryption on the flag that they give us. You can do this in whichever way you choose, I chose to make a python script that I can sort of save for later for conveniency:
```python
import codecs

text = input("What text do you want to run ROT13 on?\n: ")
print(codecs.encode(text, 'rot_13'))
```


##### FLAG
picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
