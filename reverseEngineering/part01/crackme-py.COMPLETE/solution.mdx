##### WALKTHROUGH
In this challenge, we get a `python(.py)` file to try to reverse engeneer. </br>
Here's what's inside:
```python
# Hiding this really important number in an obscure piece of code is brilliant!
# AND it's encrypted!
# We want our biggest client to know his information is safe with us.
bezos_cc_secret = "A:4@r%uL`M-^M0c0AbcM-MFE055a4ce`eN"

# Reference alphabet
alphabet = "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"+ \
            "[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~"

def decode_secret(secret):
    """ROT47 decode

    NOTE: encode and decode are the same operation in the ROT cipher family.
    """

    # Encryption key
    rotate_const = 47

    # Storage for decoded secret
    decoded = ""

    # decode loop
    for c in secret:
        index = alphabet.find(c)
        original_index = (index + rotate_const) % len(alphabet)
        decoded = decoded + alphabet[original_index]

    print(decoded)

def choose_greatest():
    """Echo the largest of the two numbers given by the user to the program

    Warning: this function was written quickly and needs proper error handling
    """

    user_value_1 = input("What's your first number? ")
    user_value_2 = input("What's your second number? ")
    greatest_value = user_value_1 # need a value to return if 1 & 2 are equal

    if user_value_1 > user_value_2:
        greatest_value = user_value_1
    elif user_value_1 < user_value_2:
        greatest_value = user_value_2

    print( "The number with largest positive magnitude is "
        + str(greatest_value) )

choose_greatest()
```
As we take a look, we can see at the top an encrypted secret ```bezos_cc_secret = "A:4@r%uL`M-^M0c0AbcM-MFE055a4ce`eN"```, that has to be the flag.
The further down we go, we can see a decoding function for `ROT47`, there is another function that chooses the greatest number between two numbers. At the end of the code, the `choose_greatest()` function is run, which is seemingly useless because it doesn't have anything to do with the encoding/decoding with `ROT47`. Let's comment out the call to `choose_greatest()` and instead run `decode_secret()` on the encoded secret that was given, `bezos_cc_secret`:
```python
# choose_greatest()
decode_secret(bezos_cc_secret)
```
Save it and run it:
```bash
$ python3 crackme.py
picoCTF{1|\/|_4_p34|\|ut_dd2c4616}
```
Nice! That did the trick.
